# MyJSON

MyJSON is a free and open source service for people looking for fast and flexible data generators. We as developers, have all been there. You're creating a project, probably in the frontend, and then all of a sudden you need some data to experiment with, but you don't want to hardcode or generate it all by yourself. Or sometimes, you could be working on the Backend, and all of a sudden you realize your databases need huge amount of data to be populated in order for you to run your tests.

 For all such times, there's **MyJSON**.
